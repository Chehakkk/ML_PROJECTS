---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml_project_suite.git
   cd ml_project_suite
- - Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run Boosting module
- python classification/boosting_classifier.py
- - Models Used
- AdaBoostClassifier (with Decision Trees)
- GradientBoostingClassifier
- XGBClassifier (from XGBoost library)
- Pipeline Steps
- Feature Engineering via OrdinalEncoder, StandardScaler
- Model comparison across accuracy, precision, and recall
- ROC Curve and Confusion Matrix visualization
- Highlights
- Handles complex decision boundaries
- Improved performance on imbalanced classes
- Custom depth and learning rate tuning for each model
- Real Estate Regression- Multi-variable Linear Regression
- Evaluation metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²
Existing Modules🟣 Clustering – Wine Dataset- KMeans with Elbow Method & PCA
- 3D cluster visualization
🟢 Titanic Classification- Logistic Regression vs SVC
- Boxplots, Pairplots for EDA
🌲 Tree-Based Classification- Decision Tree & Random Forest
- Heatmaps for feature selection
🏘️ Real Estate Regression- Multi-variable Linear Regression
- Evaluation metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²
- Car Price Predictor- Feature engineering + encoder comparison

- 🧰 Libraries Used
📦 Data Handling
- pandas: for data manipulation and structured datasets
- numpy: numerical operations and array handling
🎨 Visualization
- matplotlib: plotting graphs and charts
- seaborn: statistical data visualizations like heatmaps, pairplots, boxplots
🤖 Machine Learning
- scikit-learn: for preprocessing, model building, evaluation metrics
- Includes models like LogisticRegression, SVC, KMeans, RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier
- xgboost: for XGBClassifier, providing efficient boosting algorithms
🛠 Utility Scripts
- Custom Python scripts inside /utils/ directory:
- preprocessing_utils.py
- visualization_utils.py
- model_utils.py

Would you like me to convert this into badge-ready format for your README.md, or list Python versions and environment setup tools like venv or conda too? I’m happy to refine it further based on your deployment preferences 🔧.
